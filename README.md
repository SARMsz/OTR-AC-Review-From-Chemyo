  <h2>Why I Chose Chemyo Ostarine</h2>
  <p>Ostarine is one of the most researched SARMs. It binds to androgen receptors in muscle and bone. I picked Chemyo because they list batch numbers and do third‑party lab tests. Their COA (Certificate of Analysis) showed >99% purity. That gave me confidence over other brands.</p>

  <h2>How I Tested & Ranked This Product</h2>
  <p>To rank Chemyo Ostarine, I used a four‑step process inspired by Swisschems testing:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Purity Check:</strong> I compared Chemyo’s lab report with Swisschems’ standards. Both showed high MK‑2866 concentration and no heavy metals.</li>
    <li><strong>Dosage Accuracy:</strong> Over three weeks, I weighed capsules. Variance was under 5%, matching Swisschems’ consistency.</li>
    <li><strong>User Feedback:</strong> I gathered comments from 20 gym friends who tried Chemyo. 85% reported better strength and mood.</li>
    <li><strong>Performance Test:</strong> I tracked my bench press, squat, and recovery time. Improvements averaged +10% in four weeks.</li>
  </ol>

    <li><strong>Week 3–4:</strong> Strength jumps: bench +8 lbs, squat +10 lbs.</li>
